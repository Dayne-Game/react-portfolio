            My job was to design and develop the website, which was to be designed using Adobe XD, and developed using Gatsby / React and Netlify CMS. During the development process, Bay of Plenty Rugby had decided to go down a different road, and so the website wasnâ€™t needed anymore, so we stopped
            development.
